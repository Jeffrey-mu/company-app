In the past two years of our association, they certainly exceeded my expectations! I was unaware of mobile development when I initially approached this company to develop an app and website for medical services in my country. However, their expertise enabled them to create something extraordinary that surpasses all competitors!  Konstant's handling of my project was exceptional, giving me all I wanted and more with minimal communication. Undoubtedly, the business analyst made a huge contribution to Mednet's success story; he acted as an intermediary between myself and the developers throughout development, keeping everything in check while providing incredibly helpful suggestions at every step. As a result, Mednet is performing remarkably well on market shelves!  Since the start of our collaboration, we have completed a myriad of projects. We plan to maintain this relationship in the long term. They will be my go-to partners for any subsequent work I might take on. As such, it is with utmost conviction that I recommend Konstant Infosolutions and their team – they perform excellently in development and are also highly flexible in terms of payment! All the best wishes going out to all future endeavors - you can expect more from me shortly!","pros":["A very supportive team that helped me understand each and every element.

At first, I was hesitant about the team's capabilities. However, after meeting Mr. DD for our initial consultation, my doubts were alleviated and replaced by confidence in their competence, ultimately prompting me to award them this project. Like any budget-constrained startup, we must ensure designs are properly reviewed and features prioritized. Thus, this project must be flexible, something Konstant understands better than anyone else and accommodates through the utmost support.  We have continuously revised our design and added features that should have been discussed initially. We also experienced some back-and-forth haggling over the estimates for those additional features. However, they are determined to ensure we're satisfied with their service. They take customer feedback seriously, which is why I'm confident in their abilities despite having a technical background myself. As part of the Phase 2 rollout, I will also work closely with Konstant on this project!","pros":["Stablity - Geographical advantage - Infrastructure"],"cons":["Work environment - No guidance"],"score":{"Scheduling_&_Timeline":5,"Value_for_money":5,"Communication":5,"Quality_of_deliverable":5,"Customer_support":5,"Overall_ratings":5}},{"head_portrait":"/uploadsImg/1677639699599.jpeg","short_describe":"Best IT company in Jaipur","name":"Ryan Smith","date":"2 weeks ago","position":"UX-UI Designer ","describe":"I have worked with Konstant for the past two years, and my experience has been amazing.
